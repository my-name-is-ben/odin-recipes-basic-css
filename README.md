#Odin Recipes with Basic CSS

This is my second odin project.

It is part of the Fundamentals Introduction to the course.

##Purpose of the project

The purpose of the project is to create a basic webpage that stores several recipes.

Unlike the last project, I will be using a bit of basic CSS on an external style sheet.

##Learning Goals for the project

The goal for the this project is not to make the website look good per se, but to get comfortable working with CSS.

In this project I hope to get a better understanding of:
	
-using CSS to modify HTML elements
-learning rule priority when collisions occur
	
>Somewhat off-topic, but I would also like to learn how to make a cleaner README.md so that the github page is more legible. I will be including several examples below in order to practice and also perhaps as a reference for the future.

This is an example of a [link](https://start.duckduckgo.com) to DuckDuckGo.

To highlight a bit of important code you can do something like this `attribute: value`. It's one way of bringing `attention` to something important but should not be overused.

A SAMPLE LIST

1. Item One
	- sub item
	- sub item

2. Item Two
	- sub item
	- sub item
	- sub item


	
That's about it!
